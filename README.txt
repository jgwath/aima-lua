Lua implementation of algorithms from Norvig And Russell's "Artificial
Intelligence - A Modern Approach", 3rd Ed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a project to create Lua implementations of all the algorithms
and exercises for the Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig book "Artificial
Intelligence - A Modern Approach" 3rd edition.

One of the main goals is for the code to be clear and elegant as
possible, while taking advantage of Lua's unique capabilities.

Another goal is to produce Lua code nicely modularized so that it can
readily be incorporated into other projects.

DISCLAIMER: This project is not officially sanctioned by the authors of
the book. It is intended to be a learning exercise and a (hopefully)
good example of Lua coding practices.
